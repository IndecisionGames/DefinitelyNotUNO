- finish godot 4 migration

Server
- create minimal TS Node server to connect to
  - server should have no game logic
  - server should handle:
    - lobby management (one host, players join/leave)
    - route messages (JSON)
      - clients -> host (intents)
      - host -> other clients (authoritative game state / events)

Clients
- hosts
  - owns full game logic and deck state
  - decide if move is valid, turn order etc.
  - broadcasts state updates / events via server
- guests
  - send input/intent messages to host via server
  - render final state sent by host

Offline
- no server interaction
- player is "host"
- AI are "guests" that send intent
